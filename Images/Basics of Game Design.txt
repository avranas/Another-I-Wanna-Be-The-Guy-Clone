World 1:
teach player how to play
	basics
	simple mechanics (saw)
	Ass;
	test if you learned
	more mechanics
	test again
	World 1 mechanics tend to be used frequently
	throughout the game. (saw, disappearing block)
World 2:
central theme with simple mechanic.
You don't always have to follow this
SMB:fan, some reoccuring enemies

World 3:
Old mechanics amped up (faster saws)
New mechanics mixed with old (missile)

World 4:
More mechanics (portals)
(portals that spit)

World 5:
bigger levels I think?
More mechanics (complex)

Last:
Test everything you learned. Are you a master?
Most intimidation. Large screens, many hazards at once,
larger death penalty. Hard as balls. No new mechanis.



World 1:
basics (run, jump, shoot)
simple mechanics (spike, save)
more mechanics (platform, saw)
Got it? (all at once!)

World 2:
Some unique, complex mechanics. (windmill, missiles
This plus previous mechanics

World 3:
Moar spikes, troll spikes, moving spikes
This plus complex, unique mechanics (pounder+shockwave)

World 4:
No new mechanics. Lots of time between checkpoints. Basic mechanics at their max,
don't use previous unique mechanics. Many hazards at once.

World 5:
More time between checkpoints, more hazards at once, the most complex mechanics combined with
worst of basic mechanics
